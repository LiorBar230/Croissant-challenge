      A croissant (French pronunciation: [kʁwasɑ̃] (listen)) is a buttery, flaky,
      Austrian viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl
      but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.[1][better source
      needed] Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape, the
      dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in
      succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
      laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a
      puff pastry. Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance,
      and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity.[2] Kipferls have long
      been a staple of Austrian, and French bakeries and pâtisseries. The modern
      croissant was developed in the early 20th century when French bakers
      replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened laminated
      dough.[3] In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen,
      preformed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that could be
      freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La
      Croissanterie chain, was a French response to American-style fast food,[4]
      and as of 2008, 30–40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries and
      patisseries were baked from frozen dough.[5] Croissants are a common part
      of a continental breakfast in many European countries.
